 * Some information about the data is printed to the console. 
 * 
 * I made a few methods near the bottom of this class which calculate some information,
 * but the graph better shows the trends of the data. These methods include: average
 * value per DC, max value per DC and min value per DC (these can be used to find range).
 * 
 * Although I spent more time graphing the data, a helpful method to find trends 
 * would be to find the inflection points of the data center's info and compare them.
 * 
 * I can see in the graph that data center I fluctuates the most consistently.
 * Data center S has similar inflection points as I, but the range of difference
 * from maxima to minima is smaller. Finally, A is the most consistent in values
 * across time. A has the smallest range from highest to lowest point and remains
 * around an average values of ~3592.98.
